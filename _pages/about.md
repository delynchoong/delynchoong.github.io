Welcome to Delyn's Midnight Tech Hacks, my personal tech blog where I curate/scribble my technical learnings and research as a Data & AI Cloud Solutions Architect in Microsoft.

I focus on delivering intelligent solutions and am excited about this new era of AI. Previously, I was a senior technical consultant in IBM driving transformations to client by adopting technologies that best suits their business needs. I have delivered projects in mobile and web development, utilizing various cloud platforms, ETLs, dashboarding and monitoring solutions. Since my days in Accenture for  Cloud Migration and Transformation, the world of binary bits has changed significantly, and I'm excited to see what the future brings.
